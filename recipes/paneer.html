    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Palak Paneer is one of the most popular Indian dish made with succulent Paneer cubes (Indian cottage cheese) in a smooth spinach sauce. I share two ways to make this healthy dish â€“ a homestyle version and a restaurant style version with a charcoal smoking method.Both the vibrant green palak paneer recipes are made with fresh spinach leaves, aromatics, herbs and spices.</p>
