    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Who doesn’t love crispy, juicy fried chicken? I’ve made tons of different variations over the years and this Easy Fried Chicken is simply that – the easiest way to make juicy, crispy fried chicken with only one simple seasoning mix (no need to do all the separate dredging steps with egg)! And the best part is – it’s super delicious!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>All-purpose flour</li>
        <li>Garlic salt</li>    
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Club soda</li>
        <li>Egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat up the oil</strong> in a deep fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li><Strong>Mix</Strong> 3 cups flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon pepper, paprika, and poultry seasoning together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Stir</strong> 1 1/2 cups club soda, remaining 1 1/3 cups flour, egg yolks, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper together in a separate bowl; thin with more beer if batter is too thick.</li>
        <li><strong>Moisten chicken pieces with a little water.</strong> Then dip in seasoned flour mixture. Shake off excess and dip in beer batter, then dip in the seasoned flour mixture once more.</li>
        <li><strong>Lower chicken pieces carefully into the hot oil in batches.</strong> Fry until crispy and well-browned, about 15 to 18 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.
