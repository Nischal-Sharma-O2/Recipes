    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>If you’re wondering how to make a grilled cheese sandwich, Jack’s your guy. He makes one so often that we have a dedicated grilled cheese pan in our kitchen. It’s seen a million grilled cheese experiments in its day–mayo on the bread, or softened butter? American cheese or Swiss?–all of which have helped him work out what, in our opinion, is THE BEST grilled cheese recipe. It’s incredibly simple, but it yields an undeniably crave-able sandwich. This grilled cheese is crisp and golden on the outside and deliciously melty in the middle</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sourdough bread</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Dijon Mustard</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Cheese(Sharp cheddar and Gruyere)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Spread mayo on the outside of the bread.</strong> Not butter! The mayo helps the bread brown insanely well in the skillet, creating a mouthwatering crunch when you bite into the sandwich. It also gives the sandwich a richer flavor. Spread the inside of one slice of bread with a layer of Dijon mustard.</li>
        <li><Strong>Add grated cheese.</Strong> I find that grated cheese melts more evenly than a slice of cheese does. (Though of course, if you choose to use a softer type of cheese, such as brie, you’ll have to slice it.) Use enough to create a small mound of grated cheese over one slice of bread, generally 1 to 2 ounces of each type of cheese. Place the other slice of bread on top, mayo side out!</li>
        <li><strong>Choose the right skillet.</strong> We like to use cast-iron because it creates gorgeous browning on the outside of the sandwich. In a pinch, nonstick works too!</li>
        <li><strong>Go low and slow.</strong> I don’t raise my heat any higher than medium-low. If the pan gets too hot, the bread will burn before the cheese melts.</li>
        <li><strong>Cover the pan.</strong> Add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Then, add the sandwich, and COVER the skillet. The lid will trap steam in the pan, helping melt the cheese as the bread toasts. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Flip and cook, covered, on the second side.</li>
        <li><strong>Adjust the heat as needed.</strong> Lower it if the bread is browning too quickly!</li>
    </ol>
    When the bread is browned on both sides and the sandwich is full of melty cheese, remove it from the pan. Slice (into triangles, please!), and serve!
